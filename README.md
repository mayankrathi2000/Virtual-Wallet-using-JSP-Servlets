# Virtual-Wallet-using-JSP-Servlets

1. The Virtual Wallet is a Java based application that helps user to receive and transfer virtual money. User can login using his/her mobile number and password that is hashed using MD5 algorithm which helps in maintaining the security. Also user can send/receive money and can also view his/her transactions.

2. In this project, I used JSP (Java Server Pages) for the front end module and we used MYSQL database for storing the data at backend.

3. It helps user in many ways like saving time for doing transactions, easily accessible and convenient to use.
